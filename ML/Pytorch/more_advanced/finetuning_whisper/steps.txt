Goal: re-write the code of huggingface whisper finetuning to use pytorch lightning
1. load the dataset using lightning datamodule
* integrate huggingface loading data, or we can write it ourselves and use lightning datamodule
2. load the model using lightning module
3. train the model using lightning trainer
(4. See if we can sharded training with lightning trainer to maybe finetune a large whisper model 
that we couldn't on single GPU)

End goal: Finetune the model on our own dataset for some cool application
